The HTTP Protocol works by accepting various methods as verbs at the beginning of an HTTP Request. In this case, the two most common verbs GET/POST may be accepted verbs on the server. In that case, we would be unable to change those verbs to anything else but the GET/POST accepted verbs. 

Let's say that there are more than just the GET/POST verbs that are accepted. Now we have the ability to modify these HTTP Verbs to utilize these requests for something other than what it's intended for. 

**Examples of HTTP Verbs**

|Verb|Description|
|---|---|
|`HEAD`|Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the `headers`, without the response body|
|`PUT`|Writes the request payload to the specified location|
|`DELETE`|Deletes the resource at the specified location|
|`OPTIONS`|Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs|
|`PATCH`|Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location|

### Insecure Configurations
- A web servers configuration can cause the first type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities. 
- A web servers authentication configuration may be limited to specific HTTP methods. which would leave some HTTP methods accessible without authentication. 

```xml
<Limit GET POST>
    Require valid-user
</Limit>
```

### Insecure Coding

Insecure coding practices cause the other type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities (though some may not consider this Verb Tampering). This can occur when a web developer applies specific filters to mitigate particular vulnerabilities while not covering all HTTP methods with that filter. For example, if a web page was found to be vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability, and the back-end developer mitigated the SQL Injection vulnerability by the following applying input sanitization filters:

Code: php

```php
$pattern = "/^[A-Za-z\s]+$/";

if(preg_match($pattern, $_GET["code"])) {
    $query = "Select * from ports where port_code like '%" . $_REQUEST["code"] . "%'";
    ...SNIP...
}
```

We can see that the sanitization filter is only being tested on the `GET` parameter. If the GET requests do not contain any bad characters, then the query would be executed. However, when the query is executed, the `$_REQUEST["code"]` parameters are being used, which may also contain `POST` parameters, `leading to an inconsistency in the use of HTTP Verbs`. In this case, an attacker may use a `POST` request to perform SQL injection, in which case the `GET` parameters would be empty (will not include any bad characters). The request would pass the security filter, which would make the function still vulnerable to SQL Injection.

While both of the above vulnerabilities are found in public, the second one is much more common, as it is due to mistakes made in coding, while the first is usually avoided by secure web server configurations, as documentation often cautions against it. In the coming sections, we will see examples of both types and how to exploit them.
