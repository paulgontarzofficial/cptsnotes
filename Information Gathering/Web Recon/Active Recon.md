- Directly interacts with the target system to gather information. 
- The following are techniques and forms of active recon. 

|Technique|Description|Example|Tools|Risk of Detection|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`Port Scanning`|Identifying open ports and services running on the target.|Using Nmap to scan a web server for open ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).|Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan|High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.|
|`Vulnerability Scanning`|Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations.|Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.|Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto|High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.|
|`Network Mapping`|Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships.|Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure.|Traceroute, Nmap|Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion.|
|`Banner Grabbing`|Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target.|Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version.|Netcat, curl|Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.|
|`OS Fingerprinting`|Identifying the operating system running on the target.|Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (`-O`) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS.|Nmap, Xprobe2|Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.|
|`Service Enumeration`|Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports.|Using Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0.|Nmap|Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.|
|`Web Spidering`|Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files.|Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources.|Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy (customisable)|Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic.|
