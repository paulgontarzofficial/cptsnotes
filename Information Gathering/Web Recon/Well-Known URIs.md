## Web Recon and .well-known

In web recon, the `.well-known` URIs can be invaluable for discovering endpoints and configuration details that can be further tested during a penetration test. One particularly useful URI is `openid-configuration`.

The `openid-configuration` URI is part of the OpenID Connect Discovery protocol, an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. When a client application wants to use OpenID Connect for authentication, it can retrieve the OpenID Connect Provider's configuration by accessing the `https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint. This endpoint returns a JSON document containing metadata about the provider's endpoints, supported authentication methods, token issuance, and more:

Code: json

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://example.com",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://example.com/oauth2/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://example.com/oauth2/token",
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://example.com/oauth2/userinfo",
  "jwks_uri": "https://example.com/oauth2/jwks",
  "response_types_supported": ["code", "token", "id_token"],
  "subject_types_supported": ["public"],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256"],
  "scopes_supported": ["openid", "profile", "email"]
}
```

The information obtained from the `openid-configuration` endpoint provides multiple exploration opportunities:

1. `Endpoint Discovery`:
    - `Authorization Endpoint`: Identifying the URL for user authorization requests.
    - `Token Endpoint`: Finding the URL where tokens are issued.
    - `Userinfo Endpoint`: Locating the endpoint that provides user information.
2. `JWKS URI`: The `jwks_uri` reveals the `JSON Web Key Set` (`JWKS`), detailing the cryptographic keys used by the server.
3. `Supported Scopes and Response Types`: Understanding which scopes and response types are supported helps in mapping out the functionality and limitations of the OpenID Connect implementation.
4. `Algorithm Details`: Information about supported signing algorithms can be crucial for understanding the security measures in place.
