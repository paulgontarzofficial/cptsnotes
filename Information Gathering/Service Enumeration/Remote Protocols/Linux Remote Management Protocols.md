**SSH** (Secure Shell)

- Enables an encrypted connection over port TCP/22. 
- Available natively on every Linux and MacOS Distro. 
- Can also be on Windows machine provided we install the application. 
- SSH-1 is vulnerable to MITM (Man in the Middle) Attacks. Whereas, SSH-2 is not vulnerable to MITM Attacks. 

**OpenSSH Auth Methods**

1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication

## Default Configurations

Location: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

## Dangerous Settings

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`PasswordAuthentication yes`|Allows password-based authentication.|
|`PermitEmptyPasswords yes`|Allows the use of empty passwords.|
|`PermitRootLogin yes`|Allows to log in as the root user.|
|`Protocol 1`|Uses an outdated version of encryption.|
|`X11Forwarding yes`|Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications.|
|`AllowTcpForwarding yes`|Allows forwarding of TCP ports.|
|`PermitTunnel`|Allows tunneling.|
|`DebianBanner yes`|Displays a specific banner when logging in.|
## Footprinting the Service

Tools: 

ssh-audit: checks the client-side and server-side config and shows general information and which encryption algorithms that are being used.

Changing Authentication Method

```
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password

OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
...SNIP...
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive
debug1: Next authentication method: password

cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132's password:
```
- We can pass the -o option to specify options to change. 

## Rsync 
- Fast and efficient tool to copy files from one network share folder to another. 

**Scanning for Rsync**

```
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-19 09:31 EDT
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0058s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.13 seconds
```

**Probing for Accessible Shares**

```
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list
dev             Dev Tools
@RSYNCD: EXIT
```
- Using netcat, we can see that we probe port 873 and looks promising for an Rsync share. 

Enumerating the share using Rsync: 

```
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev

## R-Services

- Span across ports **512, 513, 514** and can only be accessible through a suite of programs known as r-commands. 

|**Command**|**Service Daemon**|**Port**|**Transport Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`rcp`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the `cp` command on Linux but provides `no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system`.|
|`rsh`|`rshd`|514|TCP|Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation.|
|`rexec`|`rexecd`|512|TCP|Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
|`rlogin`|`rlogind`|513|TCP|Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.|
**Important Config Files**

/etc/hosts.equiv
- Contains a list of trusted hosts, used to grant access to other systems on the network. 
```
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts.equiv

# <hostname> <local username>
pwnbox cry0l1t3
```
