## What is it?

- Server Message Block
- Regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. 
- **Protocol:** TCP

Samba (Go-to SMB Server)
- Utilizes CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocol
- Unix-based
- Connections to older services such as NetBIOS communicate over TCP port 137, 138, and 139.
- CIFS communicates over TCP Port 445 exclusively 

|**SMB Version**|**Supported**|**Features**|
|---|---|---|
|CIFS|Windows NT 4.0|Communication via NetBIOS interface|
|SMB 1.0|Windows 2000|Direct connection via TCP|
|SMB 2.0|Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008|Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature|
|SMB 2.1|Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2|Locking mechanisms|
|SMB 3.0|Windows 8, Windows Server 2012|Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access|
|SMB 3.0.2|Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2||
|SMB 3.1.1|Windows 10, Windows Server 2016|Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption|

## Functional SMB use

**Connecting to a share:** 

```
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```
- We can use the smbclient command along with the -N (NULL Session) for anonymous login and -L (List) to list the shares available. 

```
