- We can use tools such as Username Anarchy to manually generate a custom wordlist based on potential users that have access to the network. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ./username-anarchy -l

Installing Username Anarachy
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install ruby -y
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy.git
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ cd username-anarchy
```

**Using Username Anarchy**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ./username-anarchy Jane Smith > jane_smith_usernames.txt
```


### CUPP 

With the username aspect addressed, the next formidable hurdle in a brute-force attack is the password. This is where `CUPP` (Common User Passwords Profiler) steps in, a tool designed to create highly personalized password wordlists that leverage the gathered intelligence about your target.

Let's continue our exploration with Jane Smith. We've already employed `Username Anarchy` to generate a list of potential usernames. Now, let's use CUPP to complement this with a targeted password list.

The efficacy of CUPP hinges on the quality and depth of the information you feed it. It's akin to a detective piecing together a suspect's profile - the more clues you have, the clearer the picture becomes. So, where can one gather this valuable intelligence for a target like Jane Smith?

- `Social Media`: A goldmine of personal details: birthdays, pet names, favorite quotes, travel destinations, significant others, and more. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn can reveal much information.
- `Company Websites`: Jane's current or past employers' websites might list her name, position, and even her professional bio, offering insights into her work life.
- `Public Records`: Depending on jurisdiction and privacy laws, public records might divulge details about Jane's address, family members, property ownership, or even past legal entanglements.
- `News Articles and Blogs`: Has Jane been featured in any news articles or blog posts? These could shed light on her interests, achievements, or affiliations.

OSINT will be a goldmine of information for CUPP. Provide as much information as possible; CUPP's effectiveness hinges on the depth of your intelligence. For example, let's say you have put together this profile based on Jane Smith's Facebook postings.

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ cupp -i

- Now that we successfully have a proper password list, we can now filter using grep and the password policy. 

- Minimum Length: 6 characters
- Must Include:
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one lowercase letter
    - At least one number
    - At least two special characters (from the set `!@#$%^&*`)

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '^.{6,}$' jane.txt | grep -E '[A-Z]' | grep -E '[a-z]' | grep -E '[0-9]' | grep -E '([!@#$%^&*].*){2,}' > jane-filtered.txt
```
