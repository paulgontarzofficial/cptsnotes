In essence, Basic Auth is a challenge-response protocol where a web server demands user credentials before granting access to protected resources. The process begins when a user attempts to access a restricted area. The server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status and a `WWW-Authenticate` header prompting the user's browser to present a login dialog.

Once the user provides their username and password, the browser concatenates them into a single string, separated by a colon. This string is then encoded using Base64 and included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests, following the format `Basic <encoded_credentials>`. The server decodes the credentials, verifies them against its database, and grants or denies access accordingly.

```http
GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Authorization: Basic YWxpY2U6c2VjcmV0MTIz
