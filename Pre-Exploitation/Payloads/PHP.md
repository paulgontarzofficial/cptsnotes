- Server side programming language. 

**Getting Hands-on**

We are going back to our rconfig web application that was vulnerable to the rConfig 3.6.9 Vulnerability. 

rConfig allows admins to add devices and cateogrize them by vendors. 

Let's login with default creds (admin:admin) and navigate to the following page:

- In order to attack this box, we are going to use WhiteWinterWolfs PHP Web Shell. 
- Our goal is to upload our file using the "browse" button we see above.
- It fails initially because rConfig is checking the file type that is being uploaded. How can we bypass that? We can use **Burpsuite**

**Setting up Burpsuite:**

- Go to browser configs and set a manual proxy to 127.0.0.1 and through port 8080

- Our main goal with burpsuite is to change the file content-type to bypass the file type restriction. 

**Bypassing the File Type Restriction**

- Upload the file to the website and forward all the traffic through burpsuite until you get a file that looks like this:

Now after the upload, we can navigate to the directory where the new shell is stored, in this case it will be uploaded to: /images/vendor/connect.php

**Webshell Success**
- Now we should be able to access the webshell no problem.
