## Antak Webshell

Antak is a built-in ASP.Net included within the Nishang project. It utilizes powershell to interact with the host, making it great for acquiring a web shell on a Windows Server. 

Antak File Locations: `/usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell`

## Demonstration

Moving a copy for Modifications:
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ cp /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx /home/administrator/Upload.aspx
```

Make sure we are filling out the username and password fields properly:

Now we can upload the shell, mind you, we are still using the status.inlanefreight.local address from the previous box we did.
