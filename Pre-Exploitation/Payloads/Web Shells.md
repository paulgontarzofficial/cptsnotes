`A web shell` is a browser-based shell session we can use to interact with the underlying operating system of a web server. Again, to gain remote code execution via web shell, we must first find a website or web application vulnerability that can give us file upload capabilities. Most web shells are gained by uploading a payload written in a web language on the target server.

## Laudanum (Github Repo)

https://github.com/jbarcia/Web-Shells/tree/master/laudanum

This is a repo that has ready to go files that can be used to inject on a target. 

This repo includes:
- Web Shells
- Injectable Files
- Comprised of asp, aspx, jsp, php, and more

By default, Laudanum files are loaded into Kali and Parrot OS located in /usr/share/laudanum
- Reminder that the files need to be edited in order to be used, it only has the default values so we must tailor them to our current situations. 
- Utilize the copy command and copy the payload template to a safe spot prior to editing...
- Once edited, we can then move on to the website where we can upload our tailored exploit. 

**Key items to look for:**
- Main thing to look for is a place where we can upload any type of data or file.

- In the above image we can see that we have the ability to upload a file directly to the website. We should probably upload some files of our own...

**After the Upload:**
- After the upload has succeeded, we now want to navigate to our web shell that we just uploaded

## Lab Questions: 

Target IP: 10.129.121.50

1. Establish a web shell session with the target using the concepts covered in this section. Submit the full path of the directory you land in. (Format: c:\path\you\land\in)
	1. c:\windows\system32\inetsrv
2. Where is the Laudanum aspx web shell located on Pwnbox? Submit the full path. (Format: /path/to/laudanum/aspx)
	1. /usr/share/laudanum/aspx/shell.aspx
