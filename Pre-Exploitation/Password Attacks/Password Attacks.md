- Passwords are commonly hashed when stored, in order to provide some protection. 

Hashing Example: 

Let's take the password "Soccer06!", we can put this password through an MD5 hash or a SHA256 hash. 

```shell-session
bmdyy@htb:~$ echo -n Soccer06! | md5sum
40291c1d19ee11a7df8495c4cccefdfa  -
```

```shell-session
bmdyy@htb:~$ echo -n Soccer06! | sha256sum
a025dc6fabb09c2b8bfe23b5944635f9b68433ebd9a1a09453dd4fee00766d93  -
```

**What are Rainbow Tables:**
- Rainbow tables are large pre-compiled maps of input and output values given a hash function. 

|Password|MD5 Hash|
|---|---|
|123456|e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e|
|12345|827ccb0eea8a706c4c34a16891f84e7b|
|123456789|25f9e794323b453885f5181f1b624d0b|
|password|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99|
|iloveyou|f25a2fc72690b780b2a14e140ef6a9e0|
|princess|8afa847f50a716e64932d995c8e7435a|
|1234567|fcea920f7412b5da7be0cf42b8c93759|
|rockyou|f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c|
|12345678|25d55ad283aa400af464c76d713c07ad|
|abc123|e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03|
|...SNIP...|...SNIP...|
- In this case we can see that there are numerous passwords with their perspective hash value next to it. 
- Because rainbow tables are so powerful, salting is used. 
- A salt is a random sequence of bytes that is added to the password prior to the hashing of the password. 

Here is an example:  
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ echo -n Th1sIsTh3S@lt_Soccer06! | md5sum

90a10ba83c04e7996bc53373170b5474  -
```

**Brute Forcing:**

- Brute force attack involves attempting every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered. 

**Dictionary Attack:**
- A dictionary attack, otherwise known as a wordlist attack, is one of the most efficient for cracking passwords. 
- Rather than using every possible combination of letters and numbers, a list containing the most statistical passwords is used. Ex. rockyou.txt

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ head --lines=20 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

123456
12345
123456789
