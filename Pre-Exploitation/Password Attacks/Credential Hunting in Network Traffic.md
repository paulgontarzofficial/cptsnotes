- A lot of networks now run utilizing TLS, thus meaning that their traffic is encrypted. However, legacy systems and other misconfigured applications may utilize legacy protocols vice safe and new ones. 
- This module is going to focus on viewing traffic in the clear and hoping we can get a hit on something. 


|Unencrypted Protocol|Encrypted Counterpart|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`HTTP`|`HTTPS`|Used for transferring web pages and resources over the internet.|
|`FTP`|`FTPS/SFTP`|Used for transferring files between a client and a server.|
|`SNMP`|`SNMPv3 (with encryption)`|Used for monitoring and managing network devices like routers and switches.|
|`POP3`|`POP3S`|Retrieves emails from a mail server to a local client.|
|`IMAP`|`IMAPS`|Accesses and manages email messages directly on the mail server.|
|`SMTP`|`SMTPS`|Sends email messages from client to server or between mail servers.|
|`LDAP`|`LDAPS`|Queries and modifies directory services like user credentials and roles.|
|`RDP`|`RDP (with TLS)`|Provides remote desktop access to Windows systems.|
|`DNS (Traditional)`|`DNS over HTTPS (DoH)`|Resolves domain names into IP addresses.|
|`SMB`|`SMB over TLS (SMB 3.0)`|Shares files, printers, and other resources over a network.|
|`VNC`|`VNC with TLS/SSL`|Allows graphical remote control of another computer.|

## Wireshark
- This is a powerful packet analysis tool that allows us to view traffic in real time. 

|Wireshark filter|Description|
|---|---|
|`ip.addr == 56.48.210.13`|Filters packets with a specific IP address|
|`tcp.port == 80`|Filters packets by port (HTTP in this case).|
|`http`|Filters for HTTP traffic.|
|`dns`|Filters DNS traffic, which is useful to monitor domain name resolution.|
|`tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`|Filters SYN packets (used in TCP handshakes), useful for detecting scanning or connection attempts.|
|`icmp`|Filters ICMP packets (used for Ping), which can be useful for reconnaissance or network issues.|
|`http.request.method == "POST"`|Filters for HTTP POST requests. In the case that POST requests are sent over unencrypted HTTP, it may be the case that passwords or other sensitive information is contained within.|
|`tcp.stream eq 53`|Filters for a specific TCP stream. Helps track a conversation between two hosts.|
|`eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55`|Filters packets from/to a specific MAC address.|
|`ip.src == 192.168.24.3 && ip.dst == 56.48.210.3`|Filters traffic between two specific IP addresses. Helps track communication between specific hosts.|
- These are some examples of common filters that we may use while looking for information. 

## Pcredz
- This is a tool that captures and extracts credentials from live traffic or network packet captures. 
- This tool can capture the following data that is being sent over the air: 
	- Credit card numbers
	- POP credentials
	- SMTP credentials
	- IMAP credentials
	- SNMP community strings
	- FTP credentials
	- Credentials from HTTP NTLM/Basic headers, as well as HTTP Forms
	- NTLMv1/v2 hashes from various traffic including DCE-RPC, SMBv1/2, LDAP, MSSQL, and HTTP
	- Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23) hashes

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ ./Pcredz -f demo.pcapng -t -v

Pcredz 2.0.2
Author: Laurent Gaffie
Please send bugs/comments/pcaps to: laurent.gaffie@gmail.com
This script will extract NTLM (HTTP,LDAP,SMB,MSSQL,RPC, etc), Kerberos,
FTP, HTTP Basic and credit card data from a given pcap file or from a live interface.

- This is an example of utilizing Pcredz to extract the credentials from a packet capture.
