- In our previous session, we found some basic information that can be rather useful, such as a domain controller, the domains username scheme, among other things. 
- This section we are going to cover a common way t gather credentials and gain an initial foothold during an assessment: A man in the middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution and NetBIOS Name Service broadcasts. 
- LLMNR and NBT-NS can provide us with some password hashes that we can then crack offline. 

### LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer

- These services are Microsoft Windows components that serve as an alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine can resolve a host but DNS fails, that machine will then reach out on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. 
- LLMNR uses port 5355 over UDP
- If LLMNR fails, then NBT-NS will be used over port 137/UDP. 

How can we use **Responder** to abuse this:

- We can use responder to poison these requests that are sent. Assuming we already have network access, we can spoof an authoritative name resolution source in the broadcast domain by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic as if they have an answer for the requesting host. 

Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:

1. A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
2. The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
3. The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
4. The attacker (us with `Responder` running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
5. The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
6. This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.  

### TTPs 
- The whole goal behind these attacks are to collect NTLMv1 and v2 hashes to crack offline. 
- NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT Hash. 

**Tools to Collect**

| [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)      | Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions. |
| [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) | Inveigh is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks.      |
| [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)             | Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.  |

**Responder in Action**
- When we used responder in the earlier module we were just using it in passive mode, like a fly on the wall listening to traffic on the network. 
- Now we are going to use it to spoof some network packets.

           NBT-NS, LLMNR & MDNS Responder 3.0.6.0

  Author: Laurent Gaffie (laurent.gaffie@gmail.com)
  To kill this script hit CTRL-C

Usage: responder -I eth0 -w -r -f
or:
responder -I eth0 -wrf

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -A, --analyze         Analyze mode. This option allows you to see NBT-NS,
                        BROWSER, LLMNR requests without responding.
  -I eth0, --interface=eth0
                        Network interface to use, you can use 'ALL' as a
                        wildcard for all interfaces
  -i 10.0.0.21, --ip=10.0.0.21
                        Local IP to use (only for OSX)
  -e 10.0.0.22, --externalip=10.0.0.22
                        Poison all requests with another IP address than
                        Responder's one.
  -b, --basic           Return a Basic HTTP authentication. Default: NTLM
  -r, --wredir          Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries.
                        Answering to wredir will likely break stuff on the
                        network. Default: False
  -d, --NBTNSdomain     Enable answers for netbios domain suffix queries.
                        Answering to domain suffixes will likely break stuff
                        on the network. Default: False
  -f, --fingerprint     This option allows you to fingerprint a host that
                        issued an NBT-NS or LLMNR query.
  -w, --wpad            Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is
                        False
  -u UPSTREAM_PROXY, --upstream-proxy=UPSTREAM_PROXY
                        Upstream HTTP proxy used by the rogue WPAD Proxy for
                        outgoing requests (format: host:port)
  -F, --ForceWpadAuth   Force NTLM/Basic authentication on wpad.dat file
                        retrieval. This may cause a login prompt. Default:
                        False
  -P, --ProxyAuth       Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt)
                        authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be
                        ON. This option is highly effective when combined with
                        -r. Default: False
  --lm                  Force LM hashing downgrade for Windows XP/2003 and
                        earlier. Default: False
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity.
```

**Starting Responder with Default Settings:**
```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 
```
- We typically want to run this in a tmux environment in order to maximize the amount of efficiency in capturing hashes within the network.
