- A trust us used to establish forest-forest or domain-domain authentication, which allows users that are a part of the another domain to access resources outside of the main domain where their account resides. 

**Different Types of Trusts:**
- Parent-Child; Two or more domains within the same forest. 
- Cross-Link: A trusts between child domains to speed up authentication. 
- External: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This trust utilizes SID filtering or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain. 
- Tree-root: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. 
- Forest: A transitive trust between two forest root domains. 
- ESAE: A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory. 

**Transitive vs Non-Transitive Trusts**
- A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if Domain A has a trust with Domain B, and Domain B has a transitive trust with Domain C, then Domain A will automatically trust Domain C. 
- In a non-transitive trust, the child domain itself is the only one trusted. 

|Transitive|Non-Transitive|
|---|---|
|Shared, 1 to many|Direct trust|
|The trust is shared with anyone in the forest|Not extended to next level child domains|
|Forest, tree-root, parent-child, and cross-link trusts are transitive|Typical for external or custom trust setups|

Real Life Example: 

An easy comparison to make can be package delivery to your house. For a `transitive` trust, you have extended the permission to anyone in your household (forest) to accept a package on your behalf. For a `non-transitive` trust, you have given strict orders with the package that no one other than the delivery service and you can handle the package, and only you can sign for it.


**Trust Directions**
- One-Way Trust: Users in a trusted domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa. 
- Bidirectional Trust: Users from both trusting domains can access resources in the other domain. For example, in a bidirectional trust between INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL and FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL, users within INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL would be able to access resources in FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL and vice-versa.

### Enumerating Trust Relationships
- Using the Windows Built-in tools, we can use the Get-ADTrust cmdlet to enumerate trust relationships. 

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module activedirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *

We can also use PowerView or Bloodhound to gain more information on our Domain Trusts: 

```powershell-session
